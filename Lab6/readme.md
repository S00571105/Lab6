## Executive Summary 
Section six explored protocols that support communication of the internet, ICANN, TCP/ICP,client server modules, types of TCP/ICP protocol suite and stacks.  In addition internet security of HTTP, HTTPS, Web Browser and more security was discussed. Along with describing internet programming methodologies,URL  and allowed practice creating a web page with HTML and CSS.

## Internet Architecture
Refers to the internet architecture such as protocol and IP addresses.

### Internet Protocol
IP Address- IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP address is the unique numbers assigned to every computer or device that is connected to the internet .Currently under the IPv4 all addresses have been allocated that is the reason we need IPv6 that has a bigger space for addresses.  The difference between IPv4 and IPv 6 is: IPv4 adresses are in numbers whereby IPv6 addresses are in hexadecimal and IPv6 with it’s large space is anticipated to last thirty plus years.

#### ICANN
ICANN stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names. And the organization contributes to the global internet by ensuring  a stable and unified global Internet. To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer—a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without that coordination we wouldn’t have one global Internet. ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with participants from around the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet’s unique identifiers. ICANN doesn’t control content on the Internet. It cannot stop spam and it doesn’t deal with access to the Internet. But through its coordination role of the Internet’s naming system, it does have an important impact on the expansion and evolution of the Internet. 

### TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 

#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and it basically the network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received with the network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communication. The TCP/ICP basically work like a telephone call where someone is initiating a call. Thus the basic responsibility of  TCP/ICP is sending data packets from one computer to another.

#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The client server models that applies to TCP/ICP are that basically the client/server architecture typically that consists of a collection of computers connected by a communication network. The client/server architecture requires clients to communicate with other servers and that is where the TCP/ICP comes in to play it provides standardization ways for the clients and servers to exchange data packets

#### Layers- Application Layer
There are four types of TCP/ICP protocol suite stacks and protocols. These are application, transport, networking and data link and physical. The application layer contains HTTP-the workhorse of the web, FTP, POP3, SMTP and SNMP.After reviewing the “The TCP/ICP Model and Protocol Suite Explained” in reviewing the section of article aligning the post office with protocol stacks, the layers importance to changing technology was noted to be important due to the fact that is the advantage of splitting layers/tasks  into different layers/tasks the layers/tasks can change without affecting the other layers. Even though this example was very simple it illustrated some important points of that are crucial in understanding networking protocols.The type of applications that run on the “application” layer  is basically the application will choose which transmission protocol to use based on their function i.e. HTTP,POP3, IMAP4,SMTP and more use of the TCP. So in summary the TCP/ICP is a collection of protocols that are used on the internet. And it is named after the two main protocols (TCP and ICP) and uses a four layer networking module i.e. application, transport, networking and data link and physical
